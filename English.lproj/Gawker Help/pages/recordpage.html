				<h1>Using Gawker to Record a Movie</h1>
			</div>
				<p>
				Creating a time-lapse movie is quick and easy with Gawker.  First, enable the camera you want to record and open it.
				If you do not know how to do this, refer to <a href="basicspage.html">Gawker Basics</a>.  Once you open your camera,
				you should see a window like the one below.
				</p>
				<!-- Try to keep this text short on a task page. -->

				<p style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="../gfx/recordWindow.png" alt="Gawker Camera Window" />
				</p>
				
				<p>
				The camera window shows the current image of the camera, along with "Record" and "Preview" buttons.  
				<div summary="Why so jerky?" id="taskbox">
				<p>
				It should
				be noted that your camera will appear jerky in Gawker.  This is intentional.  Since Gawker will only need a frame 
				every handful of seconds, pulling frames off the iSight more frequently would cause excessive CPU usage.
				</p>
				</div>
				Unless recording,
				the "Preview" button will be disabled as it previews what has been recorded so far.  To begin recording, click the
				"Record" button.  This will bring down a sheet in which you can specify recording options.
				</p>

				<div summary="How to Record a Movie" id="taskbox">
					<p>
						<strong>To begin recording:</strong>
						<ol>
							<li>Click the "Record" button to bring down the Record sheet.</li>
							<li>Choose the file you would like to save the movie to and where that file should be saved.
								Note: You can specify a default location in Gawker's "Preferences" panel.</li>
							<li>If available, choose how often you would like to record a frame from the camera.
								This option is only available when recording local iSight cameras since remote cameras determine when
								a new frame is available.</li>
							<li>Choose the quality and size of your output movie.</li>
							<li>Choose the Frames Per Second of the output movie.</li>
							<li>Choose whether or not to put time information at the bottom of each frame.  Note: The font for
							this timestamp can be selected and previewed in Gawker's "Preferences" panel.</li>
							<li>Hit Record!  Or if you've changed your mind, click Cancel.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
				Once you've begun recording, you can preview your movie by clicking "Preview".  Your camera will have a red dot next to the enable/disable
				button to let you know that it is recording.  
				</p>
				
				<p style="text-align: center;">
					<img src="../gfx/recorddot.png" alt="Gawker Record Sheet" />
				</p>
				
				<p>
				To stop recording, click the "Stop" button in the camera window
				and the movie will be saved to the location you specified.  That's all there is to it!
